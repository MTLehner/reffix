# reffix

This small repository handles BibTex files for latex code projects. 
It homogenizes the entries of a BibTex database, can merge multiple BibTex databases or find duplicated entries.

## Install package
Required packages can be installed with anaconda from the file: 
environment.yml

    conda env create -n reffix -f environment.yml
  

## Acknowledgments
I want to mention the BibTeX parser project (https://github.com/sciunto-org/python-bibtexparser), which is the foundation of this repository.
